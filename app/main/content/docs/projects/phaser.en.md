title: 🎮 Game Project – Developed with Phaser
summary: English Version
---

**This project is a 2D game built with Phaser, a JavaScript framework specialized in web game development.**  
The goal was to create a smooth and responsive experience while applying the core principles of a game engine: scenes, rendering loop, input handling, and collision management.

Passionate about physics simulations and strategy games, this project represents a first concrete step toward developing gameplay mechanics focused on decision-making, logic, and anticipation.

It also allowed me to explore and work with the broader tile-based ecosystem, which plays a central role in structured 2D game development.  
Additionally, I implemented character movement animations (left, right, jump, etc.) synchronized with both the player’s input and the character’s current state.

This work with tiles provides an essential foundation for future projects oriented toward simulation and strategy, where the map, its rules, and its interactions become key gameplay components.

_The game is currently optimized for tablets and larger screens._  
In the near future, it will become fully responsive for mobile devices.
