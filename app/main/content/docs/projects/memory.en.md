title: 🧠 Project – Memory Game (CSS + JavaScript)
summary: English Version
---

**This project is a Memory game (card matching game) developed from a Domestika course, which I used as a foundation to practice both game logic and front-end integration.**

⚙️ **How it works**

The principle is simple: flip two cards, check whether they match, then either lock them in place (pair found) or flip them back after a short delay.

The code implements:
→ clear state management (flipped cards, validated pairs, temporary click blocking)  
→ a card comparison logic (using id, dataset, or value)  
→ card shuffling at startup to ensure each game is different  
→ a progression system (number of moves / timer / score, depending on the implementation)

🎨 **Layout & CSS**

This project allowed me to work on:
→ responsive layout design  
→ CSS transitions and animations (card flip effects, visual feedback)  
→ clean and simple UI interactions (correct/incorrect states, visual cues)

💡 **Why this project matters**

Although the game is simple and accessible, it is highly instructive. It combines DOM manipulation, event handling, state management, timing control (setTimeout), and styling.

It serves as a solid exercise to strengthen core front-end fundamentals before moving on to more complex projects.
