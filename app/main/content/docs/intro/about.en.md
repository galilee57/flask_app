        Why <strong>Flask</strong> when there are frameworks that are more powerful, 
        trendier, and more in demand on the market?
        </p>
        <p>
        First of all, because I love <strong>Python</strong>!<br>
        Admittedly, it’s not the fastest language… 
        but I deeply appreciate its community spirit, readability, and philosophy.
    </p>

        Developing a website in Python also guarantees easier integration of <strong>AI</strong> projects.
        Of course, there are strong alternatives:  
        Django with its more comprehensive ecosystem, FastAPI for its performance…
    </p>
    <p>
        But with Flask, everything has to be built! <br>
        And that is precisely where its greatest strength lies: learning in depth, 
        remaining free to evolve it, and sometimes — quite simply — 
        returning to simple, fully mastered functionalities.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        This website inevitably has imperfections: 
        it would have been better with more intensive use of AI.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, I prompted ChatGPT extensively to correct, 
        improve, and above all, to learn.<br>
        But a portfolio should reflect a <strong>real level of competence</strong>, 
        represent its author with both strengths and limitations, 
        while opening paths for growth.<br>
    </p>

        So please be understanding… and if you have constructive <strong>feedback</strong> 
        to help me improve, feel free to send me a private message on LinkedIn.
