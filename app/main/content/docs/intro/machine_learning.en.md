# MACHINE LEARNING AND AI

<br>
✅ 20+ process studies in Low Code (Orange/Knime) and Python (scikit-learn): cleaning (including joins) + algorithms + metrics
<br><br>
✅ First-level defect prediction and analysis models
<br><br>
✅ Optimization model based on production program rules
<br><br>
✅ Statistical training modules (JS simulators, AI videos, publication and use on LMS)
<br><br>
✅ Development and publication of generic Power BI (M-functions, DAX, external configuration) for SPC defect/failure detection models.
<br><br>
✅ Storytelling with Microsoft Loop
